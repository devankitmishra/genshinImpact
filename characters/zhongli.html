<p style="font-size: larger;">In Liyue, if a person pays great attention to details, and has insuperable criteria by which they judge certain matters, then they are called "particular."</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">In truth, everyone is "particular" about something. Some people hate spicy food, others don't eat fish, and some want their tofu served sweet...</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">But as for Zhongli, he is particular about everything. He must attend operas by the most celebrated performers, take the most luxuriant thrushes out for walks, and he must go into the kitchen personally to instruct the cooks as to the ratio of scallops and fish required to make the most authentic Fullmoon Egg.</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">Zhongli has expertise in all manner of things: from fashion to daily necessities, wine and snacks, teas and spices, flora and fauna, and he will even actively debate affairs of trade, state, and international relations.</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">But he only ever fills you in on some useless trivia, because he enjoys sharing such interesting things with you.</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">He is Morax, the overlord Rex Lapis who rules Liyue, and the Geo Archon of the Seven Archons. The very money that circulates throughout Teyvat, Mora, is named after him.</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">He has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so historian call him the God of History.</p>
