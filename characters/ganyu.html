    <p style="font-size: 50px;">GANYU</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger; font-style: oblique;">The secretary to the Liyue Qixing. The blood of both human and illuminated beast flows within her veins.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger; font-style: oblique;">Graceful and quiet by nature, yet the gentle disposition of qilin sees not even the slightest conflict with even the most arduous of workloads. After all, Ganyu firmly believes that all the work she does is in honor of her contract with Rex Lapis, seeking the well-being of all living things within Liyue.</p>

    <p style="font-size: larger;">Ganyu is not the secretary of any one leader in the Liyue Qixing but is instead the general secretary for the entire organization. Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant the mountainous piles of paperwork from various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">"What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished."</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">"I work for the well-being of all living things in Liyue."</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">How long is a thousand years?</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Long enough for the Glaze Lilies that once teemed throughout Dihua Marsh to be wiped out by floodwaters, and long enough for the thriving settlement that sprung up upon Guili Plains to come to ruin in war.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">How short is a thousand years? To Ganyu, it has felt shorter than the blink of an eye. Throughout a passage of time unimaginable to mortals, Ganyu has been working on all manner of things at Yujing Terrace.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">All this time, her mindset has never changed â€” she constantly wavers between her human and adeptus halves.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">On one hand, Ganyu the qilin finds it difficult to comprehend mortal squabbles. But on the other hand, her human blood reminds her always to hold out hope that she might someday be able to fit in.</p>
