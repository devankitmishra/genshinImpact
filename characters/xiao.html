    <p style="font-style: oblique; font-size: larger;">One of the mighty and illuminated adepti guarding Liyue, also heralded as the "Vigilant Yaksha."</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger; font-style: oblique;">He is an adeptus and the only remaining member of the Five Yakshas dispatched by Morax to subdue the demonic spirits that plagued Liyue. He currently resides in Wangshu Inn, where he secludes himself from crowds and human interactions.</p>

    <p style="font-size: larger;">What exactly is Xiao wrestling with? The tactful answer would be old grudges, unfulfilled dreams, the lamentations of the vanquished...</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">The unmitigated truth is that Xiao fights against the remnants of the defeated gods from the Archon War, which took place prior to the rise of The Seven. Morax defeated those gods and buried their remains beneath the rocks of the earth.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: larger;">However, gods are immortal. Their consciousness may diminish, but their power and hatred will always remain and spread like poison, relentlessly stirring up chaos for the world and its inhabitants.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Liyue's rulers who are aware of the truth regarding Xiao refer to he in his millennia-long experience as the "Bane of All Evil."</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">The war he fights can never be won, and will never come to an end.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">It is also an invisible war that no-one will ever witness or thank him for.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">To repay his debt of gratitude to the Geo Archon, Xiao shouldered the burden of protecting Liyue in the millennia that followed.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">His past of service under the evil god had rid Xiao of his innocence and gentleness. All that remained within him was the means to kill and the weight of his sins.</p>
