    <p style="font-size: larger; font-style: oblique;">The Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Keqing has much to say about Rex Lapis' unilateral approach to policymaking in Liyue ⁠— but in truth, gods admire skeptics such as her quite a lot.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger; font-style: oblique;">She firmly believes that humanity's future should be determined by humans themselves, and that they can even do better than the archons and adepti have done for them. In order to prove this, she works harder than anyone else.</p>

    <p style="font-size: larger;">Keqing is the daughter of an illustrious Liyue family with a proud lineage, and she is better acquainted than most with the influence that Rex Lapis has over the people of Liyue.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Once Rex Lapis' new policies are announced, some families celebrate while other grieve. The poor hope it will offer them the chance to finally make their fortunes while the wealthy pray that theirs will not be swept away in the changing tides.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;"> Rex Lapis is a powerful deity and he can be relied on for all things.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">But Keqing has her reservations about all this: What if, one day, Rex Lapis stops fulfilling his duty? Then what would become of the people of Liyue?</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">This perspective, as far as Keqing is concerned, is a lazy and cowardly one that denies there is any value at all in the existence of the human race. "If humans really have no value," Keqing retorts, "then why should we expect the gods to care about us so much?"</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Finally, the day came of her now-famous speech at the Rite of Descension.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">"Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?"</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">On hearing these words, Rex Lapis burst into hearty laughter. But as for what exactly he was laughing about, only Rex Lapis himself knows.</p>
