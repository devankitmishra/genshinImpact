    <p style="font-size: 50px;">KAZUHA</p>
    <p style="font-style: oblique; font-size: larger;">A wandering samurai from Inazuma who is currently with Liyue's Crux Fleet. A gentle and carefree soul whose heart hides a great many burdens from the past. It's hard to say if weathering life's storms has eroded any sharp edges he once had or his reserved nature keeps them hidden from view. The first time most people meet Kaedehara Kazuha, they presume he is just another trainee crew member aboard The Crux.</p>
    <p style="font-style: oblique; font-size: larger;">If one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty. But if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.</p>

    <p style="font-size: larger;">Kazuha was not born a commoner. He hails from an Inazuman noble house of old, the last son of the Kaedehara Clan.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Inazuma City is home to many illustrious clans, and the Kaedehara name was once one of the most renowned among them. But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">As the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">He had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">To Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">When the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">These are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway â€” so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?</p>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Thus did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind.</p>
